# Large-Scale_GA
A genetic algorithm developed for a large scale binary problems


Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have the ability to deliver a ’good-enough’ solution ’fast-enough’. This makes GAs attractive for use in solving optimization problems. The reasons why GAs are needed are as follows. In NP-Hard problem the most powerful computing systems take an immense amount of time to solve the problem to optimality or to near-optimality.
In such a scenario, GAs prove to be an efficient tool to provide usable near-optimal solutions in a short amount of time.

Traditional calculus based methods work by starting at a random point and by moving in the direction of the gradient, until the top of the hill is reached. This technique is efficient and works very well for single-peaked objective functions like the cost function in linear regression. But, in most real-world situations, a very complex problem arises called as landscapes, which are made of many peaks and many valleys, which causes such methods to fail, as they suffer from an inherent tendency of getting stuck at the local optima, see figure bellow.
